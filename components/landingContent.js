        Movie drinking games should be fun, easy to remember, and also not take
        away from the movie itself.
      </p>
      <p className="my-2">
        Our games have about 4-5 rules each, and each rule tries to be about
        something funny or memorable, and not lame things like "Drink whenever
        one of these 10 words are said."
      </p>
      <h2 className="">Tips for Using These Games</h2>
      <ul className="my-2">
        <li>
          - Having trouble remembering all 4-5 of them? Just pick your favorites
        </li>
        <li>
          - Want to drink more than the rules force you to? Drink casually
          alongside it!
        </li>
        <li>
          - See something that'd make a fun rule that we didn't catch? Just
          include it!
        </li>
        <li>- And of course: drink responsibly</li>
